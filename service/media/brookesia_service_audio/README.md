# ESP-Brookesia Audio Service

* [中文版本](./README_CN.md)

## Overview

`brookesia_service_audio` is the media service for audio playback, capture, AFE, and volume control.

For more information, see the [ESP-Brookesia Programming Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-brookesia/en/latest/service/audio.html).

## DataFlow Integration

The service registers provider-backed audio playback and capture operations with the Service Manager. Applications can select an available provider through the typed DataFlow contracts or the `DataFlow` helper without binding directly to codec or device implementations.
